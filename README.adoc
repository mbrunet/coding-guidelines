== Purpose

=== Intended Audience
This document is intended for software developers who are already familiar with an n-tier application architecture consisting of a javascript frontend and java at the backend.

=== Requirements Traceability

In order to ensure that each requirement is implemented and to provide full requirements traceability, developers will need to insert the requirements number in the source code comments. Inserting the requirements number in the source code is essential in ensuring that the developers did not forget to develop a system requirement while making it much easier to find where each requirement is implemented.
